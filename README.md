The outside world is filled with fear of covid-19 as is it spreading through 
public spaces which restrict the common lifestyles of the people. Our 
project hopes to accomplish complete sanitization of the surrounding 
without any spread of corona. The major part of the sanitizing robot which 
we are building has an obstacle avoidance robot as its base model and on 
top of it, we have a spraying mechanism to spray sanitizer in almost vapor 
form to eliminate sputum carrying over to the public foreign object. So, in 
simple terms, the robot is designed to change path when it detects an object 
In Front of it which helps to avoid a crash and helps to navigate through 
unknown terrain or room filled with movable objects (people and pets). In 
parallel, it is equipped with a sanitizing module that enables the sanitizing 
of the environment. The Arduino UNO R3 is used as the control unit 
which provides the input from ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles and 
from IR sensor to control the sanitizing range. The robot can be used in 
any small-scale environment. The software used here is tinker cad for 
simulation and solid works for the designing of the model and stress test.
